        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">CEO, Entrepreneur</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Being able to truly call yourself "self-made" is a gift. My mother growing up with a single hardworking mother, and my father having escaped to the states during the Vietnam war, both of them had rough childhoods and weren't able to experience the pleasures of having money. Since I could remember, they have stressed the importance of always working hard and giving everything your all, and that is exactly what I have done to get to this point. My name is Mason Ching and I am a regular person. My companies' strive to support and promote equality throughout the world. My dream is to start my own medical and recreational marijuana dispensary and labratory where I can grow my own strains and spread love. The science behind growing the plant is facinating to me and had even inspired me to take science courses. Then I would be able to start going by "Doctor"! <br><br>

        I have never once enjoyed the idea of school, studying, or tests, but the one thing I was always interested in was work. I got my first paying job at the age of 9 years old when I carried a banner for a Tai-Chi group during the SF Chinese New Year parade, I then went on to work at a library in which I was a computer aide and had to deal with the nuisances, then I went to the movie theather where I was a chef and a food runner, then onto a burger joint where I quite literally did everything, and finally settling down at a Jewish community center in which I worked as a front desk representative. Yes, I did like work partly because of the money aspect, but more so because I thought of work as "anything that you put effort into", whether it be playing sports, video games, cooking, or even chores. I try to live life with purely joy, without the need for stress and worry. Next time you struggle with something, ask yourself "How would this look like if it were fun?".<br><br>

        Here at GiddyMase Incorporations we work hard to make sure all staff and associates feel welcome and at home. My expertise in the field of making people smile is unmathed thorughout the cosmos. I garentee that every member of my family (compoany) has changed their perspective on the idea of "work" as they are now able to live a life while truly loving thier job. They say it's almost as if thy don't even have jobs because of how much they love it. The one thing I've never tolerated was people who chew with thier mouth open and smack their lips. I have never used an alarm clock in my life because my hatred for these types of people wakes me up. I also love batman. I am basically batman, as I cant stand people who try to argue with me. The Arkham Knight is my brother as well and sometimes he helps run the company when I go on vacations or secret missions.
